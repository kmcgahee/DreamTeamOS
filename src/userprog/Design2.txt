                           ARGUMENT PASSING
                           ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

This struct was created as a way to pass information to the newly created thread so it knows
what arguments to push to the stack.

struct load_info
{
  char *argv[MAX_NUM_ARGS];
  int argc;
  struct semaphore load_done;
  bool success;
  struct exit_info * exit_status;
};

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

In process_execute() the input string is tokenized into a filename and any 
additional parameters.  The filename and used to name the new thread and all 
the arguments are passed to the newly created thread.

The elements of argv are pushed to the stack in reverse order so when reading
off the arguments the process will read them in the correct order.

In order to avoid overflowing the maximum number of bytes that is allowed for a 
command string is 512.  If any command string exceeds this then a nul character is 
inserted so when the string is tokenized it will stop before reading in all the commands.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

The strtok_r() function is a reentrant version strtok(). It's important because multiple 
threads may end up tokenizing strings at the same time, which should not have an effect on
one another.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into an executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

One advantage of splitting in the shell is the executable can be checked if
it exists before making calls into the kernel to run it. A safety advantage
is the shell can check for large executable names to avoid users from possibly
corrupting the stack.

                             SYSTEM CALLS
                             ============
---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

The exit_info provides context information for when a thread exits.

struct exit_info
{
  int exit_code;
  tid_t tid;
  struct lock lock;
  int refs;
  struct semaphore wait_sema;
  struct list_elem elem;
};

The load_info struct provides arguments for the stack setup and
synchronization when loading.

struct load_info
{
  char *argv[MAX_NUM_ARGS];
  int argc;
  struct semaphore load_done;
  bool success;
  struct exit_info * exit_status;
};

The file_descriptor struct associates handles with the actual file system information.

struct file_descriptor
{
    int handle;            /* Handle # of file (also referred to as a file descriptor) */
    struct file * file;    /* File system information */
    struct list_elem elem; /* List element for list in 'struct thread' */
};

We modified the thread structure to track file, exit and children info.

struct thread
  {
    ...
    ...
#ifdef USERPROG
    /* Owned by userprog/process.c. */
    uint32_t *pagedir;                  /* Page directory. */
    int exit_code;
    struct exit_info * exit_status;     /* Process exit status */
    
    /* Owned by userprog/syscall.c. */
    struct list fds;                    /* List of file descripters */
    int next_handle;                    /* Next handle # to assign file to. */
    struct list children;               /* List of child threads */
#endif
    ...
    ...  
  };

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

When a new file is opened a handle is associate with it along with file info.
This data is wrapped in the 'file_descriptor' struct and saved in a list stored
in each thread.

File descripters are unique within a single process.  Thus a file descripter of
'3' references a different file depending on which process you're in.

The first 3 file descripters are reserved for standard in, out, and error.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

We have two similar functions 'copy_in' and 'copy_in_string' which
copies in a buffer/string from user memory into kernel memory.
When copying in a string the size is limited to a page size to avoid
copying in really large strings.  If either function fails due to a segfault
or invalid pointer then the thread is killed.

Both of these function call off to a helper function 'get_user' which
reads in a single byte.

For writing data a 'put_user' function was implemented that writes a 
single byte to a user buffer.

We did not deal with paging user data in this project so I'm not sure
how to answer this question correctly.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

The wait system calls calls off to process_wait() which finds the
child process on which to wait.  It will then wait for it to die 
by calling sema down on the exit semaphore associated with that 
child.  When the child process dies it will call sema up which will
allow the parent to continue executing.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

By implementing access to user memory through a few interface calls
(ie copy_in()) this allows us to only have to do error handling / memory
validation in one spot instead of in every function that needs to access
user memory.  This leads to less chance for error and less code duplication.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

The advantages to using a struct that wraps both the handle and the
file info along with a list element is that it allows smaller data
structures to be extended without modifying them.  Thus a file info
structure defined by the file system doesn't have to be modfied to
accompany file handles and list elements.

Another advantage is it allows the threads to hold a list of file 
descriptors associated with that thread. 

A disadvantage to this design is whenever a file handle is used to find
a file descriptor element that it requires linear lookup time. 

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We did not change this identity mapping between tid_t and pid_t.
